# MutationalSignatures_Fittingtool

MutationalSignatures_Fittingtool is a R package that allows the user to fit 96-channels mutational profiles with a given set of signatures. There are a lot of existing packages that perform a convex optimization, but most of them do not provide results that are biologically meaninful. This tool takes into account the biological constraints of a signature fit and provides sparse solutions with a very few number of false positive and false negative.
